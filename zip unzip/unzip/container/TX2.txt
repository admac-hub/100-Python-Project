If shop flor complains about not being able to scan or print labels 

check what profile they are using and where that profile is set to print in NBP NOW 
   if it`s set correctly and they not printing then do:

1- check the scanner conectivity
   a) open a tex file and scan a barcode if prints values then the scanner is good 
   b) do ctl + atl + t   to open the terminal and ping the label printer if ( you will find it on the label printer screen  is 10.1.5. ) it shows up every 5 sec 
     if comunicaiton fails: 

try to reboot first : 
 the comand to use is 

:~$   sudo reboot now
